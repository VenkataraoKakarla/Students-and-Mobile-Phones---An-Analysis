## DESCRIPTION
### In 2009, we completed this project as part of our Post Graduate program, and it's fascinating to see how the mobile industry has undergone significant advancements since that time.

### Background of Problem Statement :

Mobile means that moves by itself. Mobile phones are becoming more and more common
that life may be unimaginable without them .Carrying a mobile phone makes most people
feel more secure, especially students when they are not with their parents. Our investigation
will be to study whether this widespread use of mobile phones playing an important role in
the student population or not.

Students use mobiles either it is a necessity or they can have a mobile or they are using for
prestige etc. Our project mainly concentrates on that what factors influencing in selecting
a handset, and to know that why students are using mobiles.

The usage of mobile is mainly based on two things one is handset and the other is service
provider. Our survey considers these two in analyzing the mobile phone usage among stu-
dents. The popular handset brands are NOKIA, LG, Samsung, Sony Ericsson and Motorola.
And the popular service provider in Andhar Pradesh, India are Airtel, BSNL, idea, Vodafone, Reliance, Tata
and Virgin.

Among handset brands NOKIA has larger market share and Airtel has larger market among
service provider. Year by year the call charges and rentals are declining. This causes the
increase of mobile usage. The handset costs are also declining then purchasing capacity
increases. Usually the mobile usage population increases among students. Hence, we are
interested to know that what makes a student select a mobile.

### Problem Objective :

 1. To test whether there is any association between handset cost and income.
 2. To test whether there is any association between monthly mobile expenditure and income.
 3. What are the factors that influence the selection of a handset.
 4. What for students are using mobile phones.

# Statistical Techniques And Packages

To analyze our data, we have used some statistical tools which can analyze our data as much
as possible. The tools we have used are cross tables, statistics associated with cross tables
and factor analysis. The software we have used to analyze the data is SPSS.

### Cross tables
As our sample consists of number of variables and some of them measured simultaneously,
then a naturally arising question is ”Is there any association among the variables.” To test
the association among them we have used the concept of cross tables. Generally used test
statistic to test the association among variables is Chi-square test of independence. This
test can tell us whether there is an association or not. But it cannot give us any indication
as to the direction of association or the strength of association. It can tell only whether
there is association or not. We need to measure the strength and direction of association.
There are some other test procedures to know the direction and strength of association.
These procedures are classified into various groups depending on the measurement level of
the variables. The nominal and ordinal measures are used to test the nominal and ordinal
data respectively. As our data is ordinal in nature we have used such ordinal measures to
test and measure the association. And they are described in the following chapter and some
nominal measures also.

### Factor analysis

Factor analysis describes the covariance relationships among several variables in terms of
a few underlying unobservable random quantities called factors. Factor analysis can be
considered as an extension of principal component analysis. Both the techniques attempt to
approximate the covariance matrix. In factor analysis, we seek to account for the covariance
or correlations among the variables. Dimension reduction and interpretation are two basic
objectives of factor analysis. There are several methods that can be used to extract factors
and the principal component method is one such method. We use this method for extracting
factors. After factor extraction, we rotate the solution so that we can give some interpretation
to the extracted factors. Again there are quite a number of rotation techniques available.
These rotation techniques can be grouped into orthogonal and non-orthogonal. In the present
context orthogonal rotation is appropriate. The method we have chosen is Varimax.
