# 📱 A Study on Mobile Phone Usage Among Students

## Project Overview

This project was completed in **2009** as part of a **Post Graduate academic program**.  
The study analyzes mobile phone usage patterns among students during a period when mobile technology was rapidly expanding in India.

The objective of this project is to understand **student behavior, preferences, and influencing factors** related to mobile phone usage, handset selection, and service provider choice.

## Background & Problem Statement

Mobile phones have become an essential part of modern life. For students, mobile phones offer:
- A sense of security
- Ease of communication
- Social connectivity
- Convenience and accessibility

However, students use mobile phones for various reasons such as necessity, prestige, or entertainment.  
This project investigates whether mobile phone usage plays an important role in student life and what factors influence their purchasing and usage decisions.

Mobile phone usage depends primarily on two components:
1. **Handset**
2. **Service Provider**

Both components are considered in this study to analyze mobile phone usage among students.

## Market Context (During Study Period)

### Popular Handset Brands
- Nokia
- LG
- Samsung
- Sony Ericsson
- Motorola

### Popular Service Providers (Andhra Pradesh, India)
- Airtel
- BSNL
- Idea
- Vodafone
- Reliance
- Tata
- Virgin

Among these, **Nokia** held the largest market share among handset brands, while **Airtel** dominated the service provider market.

A steady decline in:
- Call charges
- Monthly rentals
- Handset prices

led to increased affordability and higher mobile adoption among students.

## Objectives of the Study

1. To test whether there is any association between **handset cost and income**
2. To test whether there is any association between **monthly mobile expenditure and income**
3. To identify the **factors influencing handset selection**
4. To understand the **primary purposes for which students use mobile phones**

## Statistical Techniques Used

### 1. Cross Tabulation Analysis

Cross tables were used to examine associations between multiple variables measured simultaneously.

#### Chi-Square Test of Independence
- Used to test whether an association exists between variables
- Identifies presence or absence of association
- Does not indicate direction or strength of association

#### Measures of Association
Since most variables are **ordinal in nature**, suitable **ordinal and nominal measures** were used to:
- Measure strength of association
- Identify direction of association

### 2. Factor Analysis

Factor analysis was applied to identify underlying factors influencing mobile handset selection.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Explains covariance among observed variables
- Reduces dimensionality
- Helps in interpretation of latent factors

**Methodology Used:**
- Factor Extraction Method: Principal Component Method
- Rotation Technique: Varimax (Orthogonal Rotation)

---

## Software Used

- **SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences)**

SPSS was used for:
- Data analysis
- Cross tabulation
- Chi-square testing
- Factor extraction and rotation

---

## Conclusion

This project presents an academic analysis of mobile phone usage among students during an early phase of mobile adoption in India.  
While technology and user behavior have evolved significantly since then, the study provides valuable insights into **consumer behavior and decision-making patterns** from a statistical perspective.
